# MedTextProcessor

MedTextProcessor is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed to process unstructured medical text, extract key medical entities (such as biometrics, symptoms, and medications), and provide diagnosis and potential red flags. The project leverages pre-trained models for entity extraction and integrates medical ontologies like ICD-10 to map symptoms to potential conditions. The output is a structured, user-friendly report designed to assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions based on raw textual data.
